# Release notes: version 0.1.0 (draft)

Status as of 2026-10-23: the project skeleton is built (install, `--version`, help); the generator
and the other modules are not. This draft is filled in as each module lands, and
every command and number in it must come from a real run before submission. Items marked
"planned" have not been run.

## Product description

A small data product for a vehicle-location signal. It generates a mock drive from a start
position and a motion profile, stores the point cloud, extracts the vehicle's velocity and
acceleration from the points alone, and shows the result next to the known truth. The vehicle
is a 1 m cube that moves in a straight line, forwards, backwards and stopped, at different
speeds. All data is synthetic.

## What is in this version

| Part | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Generator | Writes a hashed drive: 16 fps point cloud, ground truth, manifest. Checks itself by recovering the scenario from the data. | Plan approved |
| Loader / ETL | Verifies hashes, validates frames with error codes VL-001 to VL-006, keeps 9 keypoints per frame, and writes keypoints, quarantine and lineage tables to a queryable lake. | Plan approved, not built |
| Use-case algorithm | Computes velocity and acceleration and compares them with ground truth. | Planned |
| BI | One Streamlit app: generate, clean, analyze. | Planned |

## Install and first check (run on 2026-10-23, Windows PowerShell, Python 3.12.6)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m vl_data --version
```

The last command prints `vl_data 0.1.0` and exits with code 0. Running `python -m vl_data` with no
arguments prints the help text and exits with code 2. Python 3.11 or newer is required; only
3.12 has been tested.

## Usage (planned, not yet run)

Run these with the project's virtual environment active, or call `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` in place of `python`.

Generate the demo drive (1,000 frames, one reversal, two stops):

```powershell
python -m vl_data generate --scenario src/vl_data/generator/scenarios/demo.yaml --out data/raw
python -m vl_data verify data/raw/<hash12>
python -m vl_data roundtrip --scenario src/vl_data/generator/scenarios/demo.yaml
```

A scenario file looks like this:

```yaml
seed: 0
start: {x_cm: 0, y_cm: 0, z_cm: 0, speed_cm_s: 0}
segments:
  - {type: stop, duration_s: 2.0}
  - {type: move, duration_s: 6.0, end_speed_cm_s: 600}
  - {type: move, duration_s: 8.0, end_speed_cm_s: -300}
  - {type: stop, duration_s: 4.0}
```

Speeds are cm/s and positive means forward. `move` changes speed in a straight line from the
current speed to `end_speed_cm_s`. Durations must be a whole number of frames (a multiple of
1/16 s).

Load the drive into the lake (planned, not yet run):

```powershell
python -m vl_data ingest data/raw/<hash12>
python -m vl_data ingest --all data/raw
python -m vl_data error-codes --check
```

`ingest` prints a summary (frames expected, kept and quarantined, keypoint rows) and exits 0 when
the drive was loaded and 1 when it was rejected. The lake is queried with DuckDB over
`warehouse/`. The plan expects `SELECT keypoint, count(*) FROM keypoints GROUP BY 1` to return 9
keypoints per frame; that has not been run yet.

Query and dashboard examples for the use case and the app will be added when Modules 3 and 4
exist.

## Known issues

- No rotation. The vehicle never turns or yaws. A real vehicle rotates.
- The point cloud is a 1,000-point sample, not the full 1,000,000 points.
- Motion is one-dimensional (along x).
- Values are rounded to whole centimetres, which adds small errors. Per-frame acceleration is too
  noisy to use directly, so it is fitted over windows.
- File hashes only match when the same pyarrow version wrote the files.
- Plain Parquet has no atomic multi-file commit, no schema-evolution tracking and no time travel.
  Writing a drive is not safe for concurrent writers.
- Test tolerances come from one demo drive.
- Loading a drive replaces its keypoints, quarantine and lineage partitions one after another, not
  as one atomic step. A crash in between is repaired by loading the drive again.
- The lake is single-writer: load one drive at a time. A failed partition restore leaves the old
  data in `_swap/old-<id>` for you to recover by hand; it is never deleted automatically.
- The loader reads each drive twice, in chunks. It is built for one machine, not for a stream.
- The loader's speed limit (9,000 cm/s) is a Tesla's top speed of 322 km/h rounded up and is set in
  a YAML file. A faster vehicle would be flagged as impossible motion.
- Per-frame acceleration is not checked by any loader rule.
- Single machine, CPU only.

## Coming soon

Rotation and yaw with a non-symmetric body, planar motion, optional noise, event detection and
clip candidates, Apache Iceberg as the table format, a REST API, streaming ingestion (for example
Kafka), parallel loading of many drives, a data-quality report function, a Spark backend for many
drives, an object-store profile, scheduled runs, and delta-encoded storage.
