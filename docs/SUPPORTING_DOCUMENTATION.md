# Supporting documentation

Vehicle-location (VL) data product. This file holds the three supporting documents the
exercise asks for: the list of error codes, the architecture and design, and the release
notes. It is built from `docs/ERROR_CODES.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and
`docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` by `tools/build_supporting_docs.py`. Edit those files, not this one.

## 1. Error codes

Draft. The six codes below are agreed. Module 2 (the loader and ETL) owns the rules, and this
file will be regenerated from its rule registry so it cannot drift from the code. Until then
the "How it is detected" column describes the intended rule, not shipped code.

A frame that fails a rule is moved to the quarantine table with its code. Valid frames
continue through the pipeline.

| Code | Name | What it means | How it is detected | Example fault used in tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VL-001 | Missing frame | A frame number is absent from the sequence. | `frame_id` values are not consecutive. | `DropFrame(frame_id)` |
| VL-002 | Timestamp gap | Two neighbouring frames are not 62,500,000 ns apart. | The timestamp difference is not exactly 62,500,000 ns. | `ShiftTimestamp(frame_id, delta_ns)` |
| VL-003 | Duplicate frame | The same frame number appears more than once. | A repeated `frame_id`. | `DuplicateFrame(frame_id)` |
| VL-004 | Corrupt point cloud | A frame's points are not a valid 1,000-point cube. | The byte length is not 1,000 x 3 x 4, or the corner spacing is not the cube's. | `CorruptPoints(frame_id)` |
| VL-005 | Schema mismatch | The table does not have the expected columns and types. | The schema differs from the frames schema. | `BreakSchema()` |
| VL-006 | Impossible motion | The speed implied between two frames is beyond what the vehicle can do. | Centroid x change over 1/16 s exceeds the configured maximum speed or acceleration. | `Teleport(frame_id, dx_cm)` |

### Integrity errors (outside the VL codes)

The manifest check runs before any frame is read. It reports a changed file, a missing file,
or an extra file, and the load stops. These are not frame-level errors, so they have no VL
code.

### Generator-side limits

The generator itself rejects a scenario instead of writing a bad drive: a duration that is not
a whole number of frames, or a move whose start and end speed are both 0.

## 2. Architecture and design

Status as of 2026-10-23: the design below is agreed. Module 1 (the generator) has an approved
plan and is not built yet. Modules 2 to 4 are designed in outline and will get their own plans.
Anything marked "planned" has not been run.

### What the product does

It is a small end-to-end data product for a vehicle-location signal: a mocked data source, an
ETL, a queryable warehouse, and a BI view. All data is synthetic. The vehicle is a 1 m cube
that moves in a straight line along x. The use case is extracting its velocity and
acceleration from the point cloud alone and showing that the result matches the known truth.

### Modules

```

                                                    |                      |
                                                    +---- SDK + SQL <------+
                                                              |
                                                       [4 BI: Streamlit]
```

| Module | Job | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Generator | Turn a start position and a motion profile into a hashed drive: point cloud, ground truth, manifest. Check itself in both directions. | Plan approved, not built |
| 2 Loader / ETL | Verify hashes, validate frames (VL-001 to VL-006), reduce each frame to 9 keypoints, write to the lake. | Contract agreed, plan pending |
| 3 Use-case algorithm | Read keypoints, compute velocity and acceleration, write a motion table. Evaluate against ground truth. | Outline |
| 4 BI | One Streamlit app with three tabs: Generate, Clean, Analyze. | Outline |

Shared code lives in `core/`: config loader, Arrow schemas, hashing, the manifest, and later the
`Lake` class. Imports only point down: entry points, then modules, then core. Core never imports a
module.

Built so far: the project skeleton (`pyproject.toml`, `src/vl_data/__init__.py`, `__main__.py`,
`cli.py` with `--version`, `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`) and the shared core
(`src/vl_data/core/` with `config.py`, `hashing.py`, `schemas.py`, `manifest.py`, plus
`config/default.yaml` and `tests/core/`). The `generator/` folder does not exist yet.

### Data flow inside the generator

1. Load and validate the scenario YAML (start values and a list of `move` and `stop` segments).
2. Hash it: SHA-256 of the canonical JSON gives the scenario hash.
3. Build the speed for every frame (a straight-line ramp inside each segment), integrate the
   position, and derive ground-truth velocity and acceleration by differences.
4. Build each frame's points: a 10x10x10 lattice shifted by the rounded position.
5. Write the frames and ground truth to a temporary folder, build the manifest from the file
   hashes, swap the folder into place, and verify it.

Units are centimetres, seconds, cm/s and cm/s^2 everywhere.

### Data model

| Table or file | Layer | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `frames.parquet` | raw drive | frame_id, timestamp_ns, points (1,000 x 3 int32, one binary column) |
| `ground_truth.parquet` | raw drive | frame_id, timestamp_ns, x_cm, velocity_cm_s, acceleration_cm_s2 |
| `manifest.json` | raw drive | scenario hash, scenario, fps, counts, SHA-256 and size of each file |
| keypoints | bronze (planned) | 9 points per frame: 8 cube corners and the centroid |
| quarantine | bronze (planned) | rejected frames with their error code |
| lineage | bronze (planned) | scenario hash to file hashes to row counts |
| motion | silver (planned) | per-frame x, velocity, acceleration |
| evaluation tables | gold (planned) | errors against ground truth |

The warehouse tables use a generic, use-case-independent shape: a drive and frame key, a
timestamp, and numeric measures.

#### Core modules (built)

| Module | What it holds | Rules worth knowing |
|---|---|---|
| `core/config.py` | `Config` (fps, raw_dir, body, tolerances, fit) and `load_config` | Unknown keys and non-positive values are rejected. `fps` must divide 1,000,000,000 ns evenly (16 fps gives 62,500,000 ns). The environment variable `VL_RAW_DIR` overrides `raw_dir`. |
| `core/hashing.py` | `canonical_json`, `sha256_hex`, `file_sha256`, `scenario_hash` | Keys are sorted, there are no spaces, and a float with a whole value is written as an int, so 600 and 600.0 hash the same. NaN and infinity are rejected. |
| `core/schemas.py` | `FRAMES_SCHEMA`, `GROUND_TRUTH_SCHEMA`, `encode_points`, `decode_points` | A frame's points are 1,000 x 3 int32 values in cm, little-endian, row-major, in one binary column. |
| `core/manifest.py` | `Manifest`, `FileEntry`, `VerifyResult`, build, write, read, `verify_drive` | The manifest lists every file in the drive folder except itself. `verify_drive` reports changed, missing, extra and invalidly named files and a scenario that no longer matches its hash. A bad manifest, an unreadable file or a scenario that cannot be hashed is a reported problem, not an error. A pathological listed name (hundreds of characters) or a folder that cannot be listed can still raise an OSError. |

### Design choices and alternatives

| Decision | Choice | Why | Alternatives | When I would change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Motion model | Straight line along x, signed speed, no rotation | A cube's orientation cannot be read from its points | Planar motion, full rotation with a non-symmetric body | The real signal rotates |
| Position estimate | Centroid of a frame's points | Exact for pure translation, needs no matching between frames | Tracking one reference point | Rotation or a changing point set |
| Body | 1 m cube, 1,000-point lattice | Matches the assignment's example, small files | Car-sized box, full 1,000,000 points | Density or realism tests |
| Source | Generator writes a drive to disk | Simplest valid source | A service or a stream | Many consumers or live data |
| Config | YAML plus a validating Python loader | Readable, fails early on bad values | Environment variables only, JSON | Many deployment environments |
| Scenario validation | pydantic | Typed models with clear errors | dataclasses plus hand checks | Never needed so far |
| Hashing | SHA-256 over canonical JSON (scenario) and file bytes (files) | Standard, checkable with common tools | Content hashes, UUIDs | Needing stability across library versions |
| Raw file format | Parquet via PyArrow, one row per frame | Columnar, compact, readable by every tool | One row per point, CSV, HDF5 | Per-point SQL |
| Query | DuckDB over Parquet folders | SQL with no server | Trino, Athena | Many users, large data |
| ETL engine | pandas and numpy | Data is small, code is clear | Polars, Spark | Data no longer fits one machine |
| Lake format | Plain Parquet, Hive-style folders, behind one class | Nothing to run | Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake | Many writers, schema changes, time travel |
| Idempotent writes | Write to a temp folder, then swap the drive folder | Re-running never duplicates, a crash never loses old data | Blind append, upsert | Concurrent writers |
| Validation | Rule registry with error codes | Explicit and testable | Great Expectations, pandera | Many datasets and owners |
| BI | Streamlit and Plotly | One Python file per view | Superset, Grafana | Non-Python users |
| CLI | Typer | Typed commands | argparse | None |
| Tests | pytest and hypothesis | Property tests suit a two-way check | unittest | None |
| Not used | Kafka, Spark, Airflow, dlt, Docker | No purpose at this scale | See "Scaling" | See "Scaling" |

### How the simulator is checked

The generator is tested in both directions. Forward: scenario to frames. Back: `infer_track`
recovers per-frame position and velocity from the frames, `fit_segments` fits move and stop
pieces to them, and `compare_scenarios` checks the result against the original within stated
limits. The back direction reads frames only, never ground truth.

Limits measured on one demo drive (a throwaway script, 2026-10-23), and the limit set for the
tests:

| Quantity | Measured max | Test limit |
|---|---|---|
| Position error (x) | 0.498 cm | 0.6 cm |
| Velocity error per frame | 15.0 cm/s | 17 cm/s |
| Segment boundary error | 4 frames | 6 frames |
| Segment duration error | 5 frames | 8 frames |
| End-speed error | 24.4 cm/s | 40 cm/s |

Per-frame acceleration error reached 452 cm/s^2, larger than the demo's own signal (up to
100 cm/s^2), so acceleration is fitted over windows (6.8 cm/s^2 over 16 frames). All of this
error comes from rounding the points to whole centimetres.

### Error handling

Integrity errors (a changed, missing or extra file) stop a load. Frame errors VL-001 to VL-006
send the frame to quarantine. See [ERROR_CODES.md](#1-error-codes).

### Storage math

A full-density frame is 100 x 100 x 100 = 1,000,000 points. At 3 coordinates of 4 bytes each
that is 12 MB per frame, 192 MB per second at 16 fps, and about 691 GB per hour (computed). The
sample here is 1,000 points, 12 kB per frame and 12 MB for a 1,000-frame drive before
compression (computed). A production design would store a keyframe and the ego-motion change
per frame instead of every point.

### Scaling to production

Apache Iceberg or Delta on object storage with a managed catalog, Spark or Flink for large
drive counts, keyframe-plus-delta storage, schema contracts between producer and consumers,
partitioning and compaction, and scheduled runs with an orchestrator.

### Limits of this design

- No rotation. A real vehicle rotates, and reading its orientation needs a non-symmetric body
  or tracked points.
- Plain Parquet has no atomic commit across files, no schema-evolution tracking and no time
  travel. The folder swap protects one drive at a time and is not safe for concurrent writers.
- File hashes depend on the pyarrow version that wrote the files.
- Tolerances come from one demo drive and may widen when the property tests run.

The full assumption list is in [ASSUMPTIONS.md](ASSUMPTIONS.md).

## 3. Release notes

Status as of 2026-10-23: the project skeleton is built (install, `--version`, help); the generator
and the other modules are not. This draft is filled in as each module lands, and
every command and number in it must come from a real run before submission. Items marked
"planned" have not been run.

### Product description

A small data product for a vehicle-location signal. It generates a mock drive from a start
position and a motion profile, stores the point cloud, extracts the vehicle's velocity and
acceleration from the points alone, and shows the result next to the known truth. The vehicle
is a 1 m cube that moves in a straight line, forwards, backwards and stopped, at different
speeds. All data is synthetic.

### What is in this version

| Part | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Generator | Writes a hashed drive: 16 fps point cloud, ground truth, manifest. Checks itself by recovering the scenario from the data. | Plan approved |
| Loader / ETL | Verifies hashes, validates frames with error codes VL-001 to VL-006, keeps 9 keypoints per frame. | Planned |
| Use-case algorithm | Computes velocity and acceleration and compares them with ground truth. | Planned |
| BI | One Streamlit app: generate, clean, analyze. | Planned |

### Install and first check (run on 2026-10-23, Windows PowerShell, Python 3.12.6)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m vl_data --version
```

The last command prints `vl_data 0.1.0` and exits with code 0. Running `python -m vl_data` with no
arguments prints the help text and exits with code 2. Python 3.11 or newer is required; only
3.12 has been tested.

### Usage (planned, not yet run)

Run these with the project's virtual environment active, or call `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` in place of `python`.

Generate the demo drive (1,000 frames, one reversal, two stops):

```powershell
python -m vl_data generate --scenario src/vl_data/generator/scenarios/demo.yaml --out data/raw
python -m vl_data verify data/raw/<hash12>
python -m vl_data roundtrip --scenario src/vl_data/generator/scenarios/demo.yaml
```

A scenario file looks like this:

```yaml
seed: 0
start: {x_cm: 0, y_cm: 0, z_cm: 0, speed_cm_s: 0}
segments:
  - {type: stop, duration_s: 2.0}
  - {type: move, duration_s: 6.0, end_speed_cm_s: 600}
  - {type: move, duration_s: 8.0, end_speed_cm_s: -300}
  - {type: stop, duration_s: 4.0}
```

Speeds are cm/s and positive means forward. `move` changes speed in a straight line from the
current speed to `end_speed_cm_s`. Durations must be a whole number of frames (a multiple of
1/16 s).

Query and dashboard examples will be added when Modules 3 and 4 exist.

### Known issues

- No rotation. The vehicle never turns or yaws. A real vehicle rotates.
- The point cloud is a 1,000-point sample, not the full 1,000,000 points.
- Motion is one-dimensional (along x).
- Values are rounded to whole centimetres, which adds small errors. Per-frame acceleration is too
  noisy to use directly, so it is fitted over windows.
- File hashes only match when the same pyarrow version wrote the files.
- Plain Parquet has no atomic multi-file commit, no schema-evolution tracking and no time travel.
  Writing a drive is not safe for concurrent writers.
- Test tolerances come from one demo drive.
- Single machine, CPU only.

### Coming soon

Rotation and yaw with a non-symmetric body, planar motion, optional noise, event detection and
clip candidates, Apache Iceberg as the table format, a REST API, streaming ingestion, a Spark
backend for many drives, an object-store profile, scheduled runs, and delta-encoded storage.
